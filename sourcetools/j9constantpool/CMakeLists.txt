# CMake doesn't properly handle directory separators when building in cygwin
# but using a windows java binary. IE it uses ':' as a directory separator,
# rather than required ';'
# Note: this isn't required for JDKs after JDK11 as fixpath will convert the path separators for us.

# WIN32 will be true when the build is targeting windows, but CMAKE_HOST_WIN32 is false on cygwin
if((WIN32 AND NOT CMAKE_HOST_WIN32) AND (NOT JAVA_SPEC_VERSION GREATER 11))
